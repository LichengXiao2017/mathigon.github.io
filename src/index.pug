    h2.text-center Open Source Libraries

    p.text-center These JavaScript libraries power Mathigon, and maybe they are also useful for your own projects.

    .row.padded
      a.grow.x-red(href="/core")
        .lib-icon: +icon('core', 84)
        h3 core.js
        p JavaScript utility function and classes, including array and string helper functions, type checking and event classes.
      a.grow.x-blue(href="/fermat")
        .lib-icon: +icon('fermat', 84)
        h3 fermat.js
        p Powerful mathematics, statistics and geometry library, containing everything from number theory to random numbers, expression parsing and linear algebra classes.
      a.grow.x-green(href="/boost")
        .lib-icon: +icon('boost', 84)
        h3 boost.js
        p Simplifying browser APIs – from DOM manipulation to web components, event handling, animations, routing, multi-threading and AJAX requests.


    h2.text-center Open Educational Resources

    p.text-center All our textbook chapters are open source. You can browse the code on GitHub, or run your own local server to preview changes or additions (#[a(href="https://github.com/mathigon/textbooks") instructions]). Every chapter consists of a few different components, which are documented here:

    .row.padded
      a.grow.x-yellow
        .lib-icon: +icon('markdown', 84)
        h3 Markdown
        p Mathigon’s content is written in a special flavour of Markdown that makes it very easy to add interactivity, styling and custom markup.
      a.grow.x-blue
        .lib-icon: +icon('functions', 84)
        h3 Step Functions
        p Every step in a chapter can be linked to custom JavaScript code that sets up interactivity, events or personalisation.
      a.grow.x-red
        .lib-icon: +icon('others', 84)
        h3 Other Components
        p There are many other components: styling, glossaries, biographies, hints, and more.


    h2.text-center Contribute to Mathigon

    p We welcome additions, corrections or other contributions from the community! Please #[a(href="mailto:dev@mathigon.org") contact us] if you have any questions, or ideas what you want to work on.

    p To make any changes you need to create a #[a(href="https://github.com/join") GitHub account]. Then you can send us Pull Requests with your changes, which we'll review and deploy. If you are unfamiliar with Git, start by reading about how to #[a(href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/") set up Git on your computer], and how to #[a(href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/") contribute code to public repos].

    p There are also non-technical ways to support Mathigon: from marketing and publicity to testing, and proof-reading new content.

    p One of the most requested features is translations into other languages. Due to technical challenges this is not possible at the moment, but it's definitely on our roadmap for the future.

    //- .row.padded-thin.feature-grid.contribute
      .grow
        h3 Content
        p Write parts of the next Mathigon course or textbook.
      .grow
        h3 Software
        p Create interactive content or new features for the Mathigon platform.
      .grow
        h3 Design
        p Create illustrations or diagrams to make education more visual.
      .grow
        h3 Support
        p Help test new courses and features, and support students with questions.
      .grow
        h3 Translation
        p Make Mathigon more widely accessible around the world.

    //- p We also need volunteers to interact with students and answer their questions – both on how to use Mathigon, and the mathematical content itself. We are currently building a support and ticket platform which will enable that.

    //- p Mathigon runs on open source technologies like #[a(href="https://nodejs.org/") Node.js], #[a(href="http://expressjs.com") Express], #[a(href="http://socket.io") Socket.io] and #[a(href="http://webcomponents.org") WebComponents].
